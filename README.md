3D heat transfer in phase change materials (PCM) - control volumes numerical method

This projects deals with numerical solution of heat transfer problems in PCM. As a numerical method, explicit form of energy based control volumes method is used. This model is used to determine optimal parameters of solar air heater unit using heuristic optimization method called particle swarm optimization (PSO). Main part of the model is PCM plate with 2 layers of air flowing around it.
